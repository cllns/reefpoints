At EmberConf this year Tom and Yehuda promised that Ember 2.0 RC will be
out on June 12th.

Its great to have a defined date that Ember 2.0, Ember-CLI 1.0, and
Ember Data 1.0 will be released. However, there are currently 692
packages listed on http://emberaddons.com what good is an Ember 2.0 if
many of the packages out there aren't going to support it (yet)?

At DockYard we're committed to Ember and its future. To that end we are
also committing to the June 12th date for our Ember addons:
**ember-validations 2.0**, **ember-easy-form 2.0**, **ember-admin 1.0**,
**ember-data-router 1.0**, **ember-cli-async-button 1.0**,
**ember-cli-i18n 1.0** will all be Release Candidate ready and Ember 2.0
compatible on June 12th.

I'd like to extend this challenge to the Ember community at large. Let's
make June 12th an even bigger launch day for Ember 2.0.

But how can we target the same day that Ember 2.0 itself is hitting RC?
Ember 2.0 will simply be a removal of deprecated 1.x features.
All 2.x features will be in Ember *prior* to 2.0. You can update your
addons as Ember 2.0 approaches by supporting the latest versions of Ember
CLI and keeping an eye on any **Deprecation Warnings** that appear
during your test suites.

Help make June 12th a big day for Ember!
