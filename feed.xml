    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce &lt;a href="http://uxeast.org/"&gt;UX East&amp;#39;s UX Camp&lt;/a&gt;, a weekend of creative thinking, collaboration, and design in one big house on Nov 14—16th in &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/maps/JPqdT"&gt;Bryant Pond, ME&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t a typical networking event or conference. We&amp;#39;ll escape the busy and distracting city environment to focus on our craft alongside others interested in design. It&amp;#39;s a project weekend, a getaway, and a mini–conference all rolled into one. You&amp;#39;ll work on whatever you like with the option of gaining creative input of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The environment is intimate by design. There will only be 30 people at this event who you&amp;#39;ll eat, sleep, and work alongside. On top of all this, there will be a workshop and a few talks available to all who attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more details to come, and I&amp;#39;m excited to share them with you! Follow our &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ux_east"&gt;UX East&lt;/a&gt; twitter account or check back here for updates. If you&amp;#39;re interested in taking part in the event in any capacity, please reach out to &lt;a href="mailTo:steven@dockyard.com"&gt;steven@dockyard.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you all in Maine!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>JavaScript Performance For The Win</title>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;JavaScript performance is a very hot topic nowadays. There&amp;#39;s a lot of information out there on what
browsers do with JavaScript code in order to execute it faster. Let&amp;#39;s go over some of the tips that
will help you write faster JavaScript code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tooling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;re are couple of tools that you can use to identify and fix peformance problems. One of the
them is Chrome Developer Tools (open Chrome Developer Tools, switch to &lt;code&gt;Profiles&lt;/code&gt; tab and click &lt;code&gt;Start&lt;/code&gt;).
Developer Tools will give you a great overview of what actual happens in your application under the hood
(what functions are called, how much CPU time they consumed, how much memory). That&amp;#39;s a great starting
point. Now you can start fixing performance where it matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Non-optimizable code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;try-catch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;try-finally&lt;/code&gt; blocks will not be optimized by the V8 (to be clear, if the function contains
a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block, the whole function will not be optimized).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight javascript "&gt;&lt;div class="ribbon"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="scroller"&gt;&lt;table class="CodeRay"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class="line-numbers"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1
2
3
4
5
6
7
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="comment"&gt;// code&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; {
  iMightThrowFunc();
} &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;(exception) {
  iHandleExceptions(exception);
}
&lt;span class="comment"&gt;// code&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better way of writing the code above, would be to isolate the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block into a separate function so &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt;
can be optimized and only &lt;code&gt;iMightThrowFunc&lt;/code&gt; would not be optimized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight javascript "&gt;&lt;div class="ribbon"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="scroller"&gt;&lt;table class="CodeRay"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class="line-numbers"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;
11
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="function"&gt;iMightThrow&lt;/span&gt;() {
  &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// [code]&lt;/span&gt;
  } &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;(exception) {
    iHandleExceptions(exception);
  }
}

&lt;span class="comment"&gt;// code&lt;/span&gt;
iMightThrow();
&lt;span class="comment"&gt;// code&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Local Variables&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re using a piece of code many times, it&amp;#39;s better to create a local variable for it for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;faster scope look ups (once the variable is local scope, it&amp;#39;s faster to retrieve it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;caching (performing an operation once and storing the result will result in less work for the browser)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Literals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might sound very obvious but you should use object literals whenever you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight javascript "&gt;&lt;div class="ribbon"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="scroller"&gt;&lt;table class="CodeRay"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class="line-numbers"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1
2
3
4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="comment"&gt;// use&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; array = [];
&lt;span class="comment"&gt;// instead of&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; array = &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Array(&lt;span class="integer"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You rarely know what the size of the array is going to be in your application. Let V8 manage the growth
of the array as you add items to it. It will also ensure that the array is in &amp;quot;fast elements&amp;quot; mode and
item access is always fast. You can read more about V8 object representation &lt;a href="http://jayconrod.com/posts/52/a-tour-of-v8-object-representation"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&amp;quot;Dictionary Mode&amp;quot;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An object will go into &amp;quot;dictionary mode&amp;quot; when you add too many properties dynamically
(outside constructor), &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; properties, use properties that cannot be valid identifiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight javascript "&gt;&lt;div class="ribbon"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="scroller"&gt;&lt;table class="CodeRay"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class="line-numbers"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1
2
3
4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="function"&gt;forInFunc&lt;/span&gt;() {
  &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; dictionary = {&lt;span class="key"&gt;&lt;span class="delimiter"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="delimiter"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="integer"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;};
  &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; key &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; dictionary);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use an object as if it was a dictionary, it will be turned into a dictionary (hash table).
Passing such an object to for-in is a no no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Iterating over a regular array&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight javascript "&gt;&lt;div class="ribbon"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="scroller"&gt;&lt;table class="CodeRay"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class="line-numbers"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1
2
3
4
5
6
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="function"&gt;arrayFunc&lt;/span&gt;() {
  &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; arr = [&lt;span class="integer"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="integer"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="integer"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;];
  &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; index &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; arr) {

  }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iterating over an array using &lt;code&gt;for-in&lt;/code&gt; is slower than a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop and the entire function containing
a &lt;code&gt;for-in&lt;/code&gt; statement will not be optimized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop is almost always a safe bet. Do you need to iterate over object&amp;#39;s properties?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight javascript "&gt;&lt;div class="ribbon"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="scroller"&gt;&lt;table class="CodeRay"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class="line-numbers"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;
11
12
13
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; objKeys = Object.keys(obj);
&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; propertyName;

&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; i = &lt;span class="integer"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;, l = objKeys.length; i &amp;lt; l; i++) {
  propertyName = objKeys[i];
  &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// more code&lt;/span&gt;
}

&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; propertyName &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; obj) {
  &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (obj.hasOwnProperty(propertyName)) {
    &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// more code&lt;/span&gt;
  }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For-In&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For-In&lt;/code&gt; statements can prevent the entire function from being optimized in a few cases. It will result
in &amp;quot;Not optimized: ForInStatement is not fast case&amp;quot; bailout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; has to be a pure local variable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It cannot be from upper scope or referenced from lower scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight javascript "&gt;&lt;div class="ribbon"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="scroller"&gt;&lt;table class="CodeRay"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class="line-numbers"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1
2
3
4
5
6
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; key;

&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="function"&gt;doesNotSeemToBeLocalKey&lt;/span&gt;() {
  &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; obj = {};
  &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; (key &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; obj);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arguments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Careless manipulations with &lt;code&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt; might cause the whole function to be non-optimizable. It might result in
one of these &amp;quot;bailouts&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Not optimized: Bad value context for arguments value&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Not optimized: assignment
to parameter in arguments object&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Reassigning &lt;code&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight javascript "&gt;&lt;div class="ribbon"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="scroller"&gt;&lt;table class="CodeRay"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class="line-numbers"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1
2
3
4
5

7
8

&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="comment"&gt;// do not re-assign arguments&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="function"&gt;argumentsReassign&lt;/span&gt;(foo, bar) {
  &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (foo &amp;amp;&amp;amp; foo === &lt;span class="integer"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;) {
    bar = &lt;span class="string"&gt;&lt;span class="delimiter"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content"&gt;Barracudas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="delimiter"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;;
  }
  &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// code that uses `bar`&lt;/span&gt;
}

&lt;span class="comment"&gt;// use local variables instead&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="function"&gt;argumentsReassign&lt;/span&gt;(foo, bar) {
  &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; localBar;

  &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (foo &amp;amp;&amp;amp; foo === &lt;span class="integer"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;) {
    localBar = &lt;span class="string"&gt;&lt;span class="delimiter"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content"&gt;Beantown Pub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="delimiter"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;;
  }
  &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// code that uses `localBar`&lt;/span&gt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Leaking &lt;code&gt;arguments&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight javascript "&gt;&lt;div class="ribbon"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="scroller"&gt;&lt;table class="CodeRay"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="function"&gt;leaksArguments&lt;/span&gt;() {
  &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; args = [].slice.call(&lt;span class="local-variable"&gt;arguments&lt;/span&gt;);
  &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// code that uses `args`&lt;/span&gt;
}

&lt;span class="comment"&gt;// does not leak arguments&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="comment"&gt;// accessing `arguments.length` is just an integer and doesn't materialize&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="comment"&gt;// `arguments` object&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="function"&gt;doesNotLeakArguments&lt;/span&gt;() {
  &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; args = &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Array(&lt;span class="local-variable"&gt;arguments&lt;/span&gt;.length);

  &lt;span class="keyword"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; i = &lt;span class="integer"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;; i &amp;lt; args.length; ++i) {
    &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// `i` is always valid index in the arguments object&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// so we merely retrieve the value&lt;/span&gt;
    args[i] = &lt;span class="local-variable"&gt;arguments&lt;/span&gt;[i];
  }
  &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// code that uses `args`&lt;/span&gt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, that in most cases optimizing takes more code. You can probably write a build step for that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight javascript "&gt;&lt;div class="ribbon"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="scroller"&gt;&lt;table class="CodeRay"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td class="line-numbers"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1
2
3
4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="keyword"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="function"&gt;doesNotLeakArguments&lt;/span&gt;() {
  arguments_slice(args, &lt;span class="local-variable"&gt;arguments&lt;/span&gt;);
  &lt;span class="comment"&gt;// code that uses `args`&lt;/span&gt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <name>Article Author</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This article serves as a continuation of a “Client Targeted” article recently published by our own Michael Dupuis (&lt;a href="http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/09/12/features-as-business-objectives.html"&gt;Features As Business Objectives&lt;/a&gt;). These posts aim to provide our current and prospective clients insight into how we approach development at DockYard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building &amp;quot;Quality&amp;quot; software does not happen by accident. It is actually one of the unspoken sides of the “iron triangle” of project constraints (Scope, Cost, Time) - or should we call it a diamond now? Let’s not go there! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/DEWme3R.jpg" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When making an investment in development of an application, the level of desired quality influences project cost and schedule.  Building an appropriate Quality Plan for a project requires time, planning and execution which is the responsibility of DockYard and the clients with whom we engage.  Below I layout the primary types of quality related practices we may consider applying to our (your) projects; always driven by clients’ unique context (See my earlier blog post about context driving practices - &lt;a href="http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/06/06/process-paradox.html"&gt;Process Paradox&lt;/a&gt;).  This article does not serve to describe these quality practices in depth but will cover the basics in terms of how they could apply to client projects.  Any one of these practices in isolation is not an effective recipe for quality, it is the degree to which these practices are commingled in a logical way that results in positive outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Practice #1 - Test-Driven Development / Automated Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the Engineer writes a line of code they are investing time in thinking about and writing the appropriate test cases for the code - these tests will serve as a functional quality benchmark which the engineer can code towards. In parallel these efforts build up a library of automated tests that will ensure that the “working” features built early in the project continue to work when new features (code) are introduced later on.  If we don’t have these tests and we have 1000’s of lines of code, testing/debugging overhead raises exponentially which will result in increased risk to project cost and/or desired schedule.  It’s also important to note that this practice is functionally-centric and not visual which is addressed with other practices described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What this means to the client&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost and eventual savings related to this practice manifest themselves as time spent thinking vs. coding vs. testing. When we estimate what it will take to develop a given feature, we consider the time spent thinking about these tests, writing the tests, maintaining the tests in addition to writing the feature code.  However, keep in mind that the time spent testing later on in the project, when the code base has grown exponentially, is reduced due to this upfront investment of time (see figure below) because we have a growing set of automated tests that will ensure we continue to maintain high quality throughout the development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/2HBq9ie.jpg" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Practice #2 - Pair Programing / Code Reviews&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes (usually) two heads are better than one.  Pair Programming is exactly as it is described. Two engineers team up to work side by side on a single unit of code (or feature.) In a 2013 article published by the Economist a study conducted by Laurie Williams of the University of Utah showed “&lt;em&gt;...paired programmers are 15% slower than two independent individual programmers, while &amp;quot;error-free&amp;quot; code increased from 70% to 85%. Since testing and debugging are often many times more costly than initial programming, this is an impressive result. Pairs typically consider more design alternatives than programmers working alone, and arrive at simpler, more maintainable designs; they also catch design defects early.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Code Reviews by a peer or more senior engineer serve to ensure that the code being written meets agreed best practices and that mistakes of the past don’t get reintroduced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What this means to the client&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pair programing and Code Reviews are practices DockYard believes yield higher quality code while also establishing a continuous learning culture across our engineering team.  The extent to which we apply these practices is less variable in that it is part of our company DNA - however, like any practice, a client’s project context will dictate the extent to which these apply.  The client will incur the benefit of a well rounded and productive engineering team which can translate to reduced project cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Practice #3 - Manual Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a literal sense this is the type of testing conducted by a human who seeks to ensure the less common use cases which may not have been exercised by an Automated Test or code review are working as expected. Additionally, this type of testing ensures the visual design of the product has been upheld -  Spacing, pixels, colors, fonts, etc.  Browser compatibility is also something manual testing will verify. This type of testing is usually conducted by members of the project team and the client. They work in collaboration across the feature set, report and classify severity of bugs which are eventually assigned to engineers when appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What this means to the client&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client should be prepared to be a very active participant in this practice and schedule their time accordingly.  Feature complexity will drive the amount of time required for this type of testing - which might be nil if complexity is low.  A very rich user experience will require more testing and thus manifest itself in terms of increased time/cost.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Practice #4 - Client Demos (and Acceptance Testing)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most projects we work in 1-2 week iterations (sprints) and at the conclusion of this time period we typically demonstrate the progress we have made by sharing working software. These demonstrations serve a dual purpose:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gives the client opportunity to verify development is proceeding in the desired direction, and if not, attempt to course correct early on vs. late in the project when course correction can be very costly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows the team to reflect and continuously improve how they are executing the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a feature is ready for prime time, we will usually ask the client to formally accept the feature as complete.  This ensures the team can shift their full focus and attention to building the next features on the backlog. Context switching can be very costly in terms of productivity, therefore we try to call things “Done Done” before moving on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What this means to the client&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to manual testing, client should be prepared to be a very active participant in both demos and conducting acceptance testing within agreed timeframes.  Deviation from established timeframes will result in increased project cost/time.  Therefore, whenever we engage with a client, we request upfront a high level of collaboration and availability to keep things moving along.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully after reading this article, you have gained an appreciation for some of the considerations we make in terms building quality into our projects.  The level of quality a client desires and the pride DockYard has in its deliverables drives the extent to which these practices are utilized.  Therefore, if you are interested in engaging with us, think about the level of quality you expect and we will work together to derive an appropriate quality plan that balances your cost and time constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reducing Project Costs: Features As Business Objectives</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="/2014/09/12/features-as-business-objectives.html"/>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of insight a developer can offer when it comes to reducing costs associated with building web applications. While few developers have MBA degrees, we are “in the trenches” when it comes to bringing a project from &lt;a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ideation_(idea_generation)"&gt;ideation&lt;/a&gt; to completion. We see where projects go astray and where in the process complexity gets introduced, timelines get pushed out, and costs rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failed features are a significant cost to any project. I’m defining a failed feature as a feature which gets implemented by the developer correctly, but which was ill-conceived in the planning stages. There’s no 404 error pages, just poor user experiences that don’t serve the application’s aim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate failed features, there is a first principle that I think clients should apply at the outset of any software project: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Align the application’s features with business goals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Have attainable goals,” is something you hear in a range of industries – from fitness to financial planning. For example, it is common when designing an investment portfolio to come up with a baseline for what you’d like to have saved by the time you retire. Goals help quantify short-term success (meeting monthly savings goals) and bring context to immediate financial decisions (going on an extravagant vacation vs contributing to the 401k).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many regards, defining business goals is far harder than designing a feature for an application. Developers can implement an idea, but if the idea is not well grounded or refined enough, the implementation does not matter. Application consumers will not be able to use the feature in a way that translates to success for the business. For all intents and purposes, the feature is “broken” and costs are about to go up because it will need to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why coming to a consultancy with a list of features is problematic. Features are not grounded in any sort of reasoning; business objectives are. Enter the planning process with a set of business objectives for the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a simple case. A client is overhauling their marketing site. They sit down in their first planning meeting with the designers and developers and say “we want a blog.” A blog is a feature – it is not a business objective. What would be more helpful from the designer and developers’ perspectives is to hear: “we want a way to show prospective clients that our firm is transparent.” This a business objective. It informs the designer that there is a target audience to design for (prospective clients). It tells the designer a little bit about the client’s values (transparency). Yes, it may lead to a blog, but what’s important is that it grounds the feature with a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features must align with business goals, because they create the theoretical framework in which the application operates; the alternative is an aimless application with a lot of code, a lot of options, and a lot of usability problems. Designing a user experience which gets the consumer from point A to point B becomes difficult because there is not a logical consistency to the elements in the application. Features do not have a unique roles, and so the designer cannot delegate responsibility in a predictable manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features that are not aligned with business objectives are expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying, but clear design thinking translates into cleaner implementations for the developers building the application. Features can be added, removed, and enhanced without hurting other elements of the application. Code becomes less coupled, is more maintainable, and can be better tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features without well-defined roles don’t have a place in the application’s ecosystem, and so they often fail. This is a worst case scenario. It means that users can’t interact with the application in a way that’s meaningful for the business. And since these failed features need to be fixed and re-worked to meet the business objective (which should have been known and communicated at the outset of the project “discovery” process), the client has expended the following resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the time that went into designing and implementing the failed feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cost that went into designing and implementing the failed feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the time that will go into designing and implementing the correct feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cost that will go into designing and implementing the correct feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is to say nothing of the opportunity costs. While one client is figuring all of this out, a competitor who aligned their features with their business objectives and “got it right” on the first attempt is gaining happy, new users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a businesses hires a software consultancy to develop an application, they’re bringing in skills and expertise from the outside. It’s unlikely that a developer is going to advise a client on how to gain market share, and it’s just as unlikely that a client is going to open a designer/developer’s eyes to a new application feature. Rather than planning an application around a set of features, clients can make the most of a consultancy&amp;#39;s resources by coming to the planning stages of a project with well-defined business objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Fear of Failure</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="/2014/09/11/fear-of-failure.html"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When confronted with a new task it&amp;#39;s natural for someone to feel a sense of anxious hesitation. Sure, it varies between individuals depending on the activity or setting, but entering an unfamiliar scenario can make anyone feel uncomfortable. Often this anxiety leads someone to succumb to their fears of failure, which ultimately results in them not even taking a chance at learning something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one wants to be a failure - there&amp;#39;s a connotation that you should just give up or else be publicly humiliated. Thanks to the recent development of social networks, anyone can declare someone as a failure simply by leaving a comment on a video online or posting blanketed statements on various articles - all the while never having to say it to their face directly or give useful constructive feedback. This mentality comes from a very judgmental and one sided declaration that spurs from people&amp;#39;s fear of being a failure themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alone, the term failure is a simple solution to a more complex problem. It&amp;#39;s quick to label the scenario as everything having gone wrong rather than taking the time necessary to provide constructive feedback or to consider steps leading up to the &amp;quot;failure&amp;quot;. By neglecting to reflect on the the particulars of the situation we are not learning from our mis-steps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than refer to these results as failures, I like to think of them as mistakes, granting more leniency to a lifetime of self-educating. While a failure feels conclusive, a mistake feels like a small part of a whole, which is more representative of how learning a new skill or concept should be. We should always be approaching the chance to learn something new with an optimistic and open mind, and the only way to do that successfully is to embrace the fact that you&amp;#39;re bound to make mistakes along the way. Think about it; if a kid messes up, we don&amp;#39;t instantly jump to calling them a failure. We let them know that it&amp;#39;s okay, they&amp;#39;ve made a mistake, but then we follow up with an instruction or demonstration on how they could improve next time. This ability to showcase compassion when sharing ideas is how we&amp;#39;ve come so far as a human race. We tend to be most curious as children because we&amp;#39;re unaware of the cultural judgment that comes from not being right all the time. We&amp;#39;re still willing to experiment without that fear of failure. The curiosity to learn something new is an exciting one, where we focus on ourselves improving and not the jealousy of what others have accomplished, so why not treat our entire lifetime of learning with a similar level of patience and understanding? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear can be incredibly influential when learning something new as long as it&amp;#39;s used to fuel the fire and not extinguish it - prove it wrong. Instead of focusing on what you have to accomplish and getting overwhelmed, take time to learn at your own pace; as they say, patience is a virtue. The best way to learn is to dive right in without thinking too heavily. By getting directly involved you will be learning through a hands on experience, which helps to reconfirm what works and what doesn&amp;#39;t. As with most things, repetition is key to retaining information.  If you&amp;#39;re willing to make mistakes along the way, jump right in and get your hands dirty. Not only will you avoid wasting time hesitating, but you&amp;#39;re forced to find a solution now that you&amp;#39;ve already begun. The less you think in these scenarios, the better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to learn we must be willing to make mistakes. Hundreds if not thousands of them. You&amp;#39;ll probably even make some incredible, irreversible messes along the way. But rather than wasting time to criticize yourself or worry about what others think of you, focus on the task at hand. Take time to acknowledge what wasn&amp;#39;t working, why it wasn&amp;#39;t working, and move on. It&amp;#39;s as simple as that. Ultimately our biggest failures lead to our greatest successes. So in order for us to improve and grow as individuals as well as a society we must try to overcome this fear or else we&amp;#39;ll never progress, and that&amp;#39;s the real failure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comics and Big Data</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been into comics or graphic novels. They’ve always remained in my periphery, but I never took the time to be interested in them. I appreciated good illustration, but rarely watched animations (except for Disney and Pixar of course) and pretty much ruled out that I would never “get” the appeal of a comic book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a data mining class last semester, and we discussed the importance of &lt;strong&gt;visual storytelling&lt;/strong&gt;. I jotted down notes and took away a comprehensive understanding of design implications - keep colors relative and consistent, scale, got it, check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/camd/artdesign/people/dietmar-offenhuber/"&gt;Dietmar&lt;/a&gt;, my professor, had mentioned a book by Scott McCloud, &lt;a href="http://scottmccloud.com/2-print/1-uc/"&gt;Understanding Comics&lt;/a&gt;, and suggested looking to comics and film as an important metaphor for data visualization. Though I didn’t pay much attention at the time, this notion stuck with me, and a few weeks ago I invested in that very book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comics are a brilliant demonstration of visualizations that show multivariate information. Interactions, emotions, time, and space are all present, concurrent, and in flux - using frames and transitions to move the reader from one thought to the next. Comics pay attention to the readability of a story, by piecing together &amp;quot;juxtaposed images in deliberate sequence.&amp;quot; (McCloud, &lt;em&gt;Understanding Comics&lt;/em&gt;) Unlike film, however, the static nature of comics leaves room for creative challenges balancing those variables simultaneously, especially the evolution of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of information graphics is subject to the same dimensional considerations. Data Visualization is a balance of data analytics, visual representations, and a narration which provides a context for each investigation. Designing complex data to be comprehensive, interactive, and inviting is quite a challenge. While there are tools we can use to inspire visualization methods and techniques, there is much more to consider. There is an entire science behind visual cognition; why humans respond to certain characteristics faster than others (to be elaborated on at another point in time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To incorporate storytelling into data visualization is to consider who we design for. Like comics, we must create an environment for the audience to become immersed, and the presentation of ideas shapes the interaction. The visual language we use, the way we sequence through visualizations, directly influences the legibility of the information. When we embrace the humanism of comprehension and perception, we design the experience to promote the success of the reader&amp;#39;s ability to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s design to agitate curiosity and engagement. How can we utilize visual storytelling to inspire research, critical analysis, and conversation? Harnessing the power of design, we can draw inspiration from comics, and present information in a way that considers how the mind observes and acquires ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it were, I’m now devouring comics - making up for lost time. I’ve put my summer reading list on hold - to make time for books shared with me from fellow designers at DockYard, who maybe not so surprisingly, already have a deep appreciation and love for the brilliant medium that is comics.&lt;/p&gt;
