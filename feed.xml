    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of insight a developer can offer when it comes to reducing costs associated with building web applications. While few developers have MBA degrees, we are “in the trenches” when it comes to bringing a project from &lt;a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ideation_(idea_generation)"&gt;ideation&lt;/a&gt; to completion. We see where projects go astray and where in the process complexity gets introduced, timelines get pushed out, and costs rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failed features are a significant cost to any project. I’m defining a failed feature as a feature which gets implemented by the developer correctly, but which was ill-conceived in the planning stages. There’s no 404 error pages, just poor user experiences that don’t serve the application’s aim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate failed features, there is a first principle that I think clients should apply at the outset of any software project: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Align the application’s features with business goals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Have attainable goals,” is something you hear in a range of industries – from fitness to financial planning. For example, it is common when designing an investment portfolio to come up with a baseline for what you’d like to have saved by the time you retire. Goals help quantify short-term success (meeting monthly savings goals) and bring context to immediate financial decisions (going on an extravagant vacation vs contributing to the 401k).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many regards, defining business goals is far harder than designing a feature for an application. Developers can implement an idea, but if the idea is not well grounded or refined enough, the implementation does not matter. Application consumers will not be able to use the feature in a way that translates to success for the business. For all intents and purposes, the feature is “broken” and costs are about to go up because it will need to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why coming to a consultancy with a list of features is problematic. Features are not grounded in any sort of reasoning; business objectives are. Enter the planning process with a set of business objectives for the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a simple case. A client is overhauling their marketing site. They sit down in their first planning meeting with the designers and developers and say “we want a blog.” A blog is a feature – it is not a business objective. What would be more helpful from the designer and developers’ perspectives is to hear: “we want a way to show prospective clients that our firm is transparent.” This a business objective. It informs the designer that there is a target audience to design for (prospective clients). It tells the designer a little bit about the client’s values (transparency). Yes, it may lead to a blog, but what’s important is that it grounds the feature with a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features must align with business goals, because they create the theoretical framework in which the application operates; the alternative is an aimless application with a lot of code, a lot of options, and a lot of usability problems. Designing a user experience which gets the consumer from point A to point B becomes difficult because there is not a logical consistency to the elements in the application. Features do not have a unique roles, and so the designer cannot delegate responsibility in a predictable manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features that are not aligned with business objectives are expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying, but clear design thinking translates into cleaner implementations for the developers building the application. Features can be added, removed, and enhanced without hurting other elements of the application. Code becomes less coupled, is more maintainable, and can be better tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features without well-defined roles don’t have a place in the application’s ecosystem, and so they often fail. This is a worst case scenario. It means that users can’t interact with the application in a way that’s meaningful for the business. And since these failed features need to be fixed and re-worked to meet the business objective (which should have been known and communicated at the outset of the project “discovery” process), the client has expended the following resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the time that went into designing and implementing the failed feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cost that went into designing and implementing the failed feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the time that will go into designing and implementing the correct feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cost that will go into designing and implementing the correct feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is to say nothing of the opportunity costs. While one client is figuring all of this out, a competitor who aligned their features with their business objectives and “got it right” on the first attempt is gaining happy, new users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a businesses hires a software consultancy to develop an application, they’re bringing in skills and expertise from the outside. It’s unlikely that a developer is going to advise a client on how to gain market share, and it’s just as unlikely that a client is going to open a designer/developer’s eyes to a new application feature. Rather than planning an application around a set of features, clients can make the most of a consultancy&amp;#39;s resources by coming to the planning stages of a project with well-defined business objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Fear of Failure</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="/2014/09/11/fear-of-failure.html"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When confronted with a new task it&amp;#39;s natural for someone to feel a sense of anxious hesitation. Sure, it varies between individuals depending on the activity or setting, but entering an unfamiliar scenario can make anyone feel uncomfortable. Often this anxiety leads someone to succumb to their fears of failure, which ultimately results in them not even taking a chance at learning something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one wants to be a failure - there&amp;#39;s a connotation that you should just give up or else be publicly humiliated. Thanks to the recent development of social networks, anyone can declare someone as a failure simply by leaving a comment on a video online or posting blanketed statements on various articles - all the while never having to say it to their face directly or give useful constructive feedback. This mentality comes from a very judgmental and one sided declaration that spurs from people&amp;#39;s fear of being a failure themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alone, the term failure is a simple solution to a more complex problem. It&amp;#39;s quick to label the scenario as everything having gone wrong rather than taking the time necessary to provide constructive feedback or to consider steps leading up to the &amp;quot;failure&amp;quot;. By neglecting to reflect on the the particulars of the situation we are not learning from our mis-steps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than refer to these results as failures, I like to think of them as mistakes, granting more leniency to a lifetime of self-educating. While a failure feels conclusive, a mistake feels like a small part of a whole, which is more representative of how learning a new skill or concept should be. We should always be approaching the chance to learn something new with an optimistic and open mind, and the only way to do that successfully is to embrace the fact that you&amp;#39;re bound to make mistakes along the way. Think about it; if a kid messes up, we don&amp;#39;t instantly jump to calling them a failure. We let them know that it&amp;#39;s okay, they&amp;#39;ve made a mistake, but then we follow up with an instruction or demonstration on how they could improve next time. This ability to showcase compassion when sharing ideas is how we&amp;#39;ve come so far as a human race. We tend to be most curious as children because we&amp;#39;re unaware of the cultural judgment that comes from not being right all the time. We&amp;#39;re still willing to experiment without that fear of failure. The curiosity to learn something new is an exciting one, where we focus on ourselves improving and not the jealousy of what others have accomplished, so why not treat our entire lifetime of learning with a similar level of patience and understanding? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear can be incredibly influential when learning something new as long as it&amp;#39;s used to fuel the fire and not extinguish it - prove it wrong. Instead of focusing on what you have to accomplish and getting overwhelmed, take time to learn at your own pace; as they say, patience is a virtue. The best way to learn is to dive right in without thinking too heavily. By getting directly involved you will be learning through a hands on experience, which helps to reconfirm what works and what doesn&amp;#39;t. As with most things, repetition is key to retaining information.  If you&amp;#39;re willing to make mistakes along the way, jump right in and get your hands dirty. Not only will you avoid wasting time hesitating, but you&amp;#39;re forced to find a solution now that you&amp;#39;ve already begun. The less you think in these scenarios, the better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to learn we must be willing to make mistakes. Hundreds if not thousands of them. You&amp;#39;ll probably even make some incredible, irreversible messes along the way. But rather than wasting time to criticize yourself or worry about what others think of you, focus on the task at hand. Take time to acknowledge what wasn&amp;#39;t working, why it wasn&amp;#39;t working, and move on. It&amp;#39;s as simple as that. Ultimately our biggest failures lead to our greatest successes. So in order for us to improve and grow as individuals as well as a society we must try to overcome this fear or else we&amp;#39;ll never progress, and that&amp;#39;s the real failure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comics and Big Data</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been into comics or graphic novels. They’ve always remained in my periphery, but I never took the time to be interested in them. I appreciated good illustration, but rarely watched animations (except for Disney and Pixar of course) and pretty much ruled out that I would never “get” the appeal of a comic book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a data mining class last semester, and we discussed the importance of &lt;strong&gt;visual storytelling&lt;/strong&gt;. I jotted down notes and took away a comprehensive understanding of design implications - keep colors relative and consistent, scale, got it, check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/camd/artdesign/people/dietmar-offenhuber/"&gt;Dietmar&lt;/a&gt;, my professor, had mentioned a book by Scott McCloud, &lt;a href="http://scottmccloud.com/2-print/1-uc/"&gt;Understanding Comics&lt;/a&gt;, and suggested looking to comics and film as an important metaphor for data visualization. Though I didn’t pay much attention at the time, this notion stuck with me, and a few weeks ago I invested in that very book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comics are a brilliant demonstration of visualizations that show multivariate information. Interactions, emotions, time, and space are all present, concurrent, and in flux - using frames and transitions to move the reader from one thought to the next. Comics pay attention to the readability of a story, by piecing together &amp;quot;juxtaposed images in deliberate sequence.&amp;quot; (McCloud, &lt;em&gt;Understanding Comics&lt;/em&gt;) Unlike film, however, the static nature of comics leaves room for creative challenges balancing those variables simultaneously, especially the evolution of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of information graphics is subject to the same dimensional considerations. Data Visualization is a balance of data analytics, visual representations, and a narration which provides a context for each investigation. Designing complex data to be comprehensive, interactive, and inviting is quite a challenge. While there are tools we can use to inspire visualization methods and techniques, there is much more to consider. There is an entire science behind visual cognition; why humans respond to certain characteristics faster than others (to be elaborated on at another point in time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To incorporate storytelling into data visualization is to consider who we design for. Like comics, we must create an environment for the audience to become immersed, and the presentation of ideas shapes the interaction. The visual language we use, the way we sequence through visualizations, directly influences the legibility of the information. When we embrace the humanism of comprehension and perception, we design the experience to promote the success of the reader&amp;#39;s ability to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s design to agitate curiosity and engagement. How can we utilize visual storytelling to inspire research, critical analysis, and conversation? Harnessing the power of design, we can draw inspiration from comics, and present information in a way that considers how the mind observes and acquires ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it were, I’m now devouring comics - making up for lost time. I’ve put my summer reading list on hold - to make time for books shared with me from fellow designers at DockYard, who maybe not so surprisingly, already have a deep appreciation and love for the brilliant medium that is comics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have attended a lot of concerts, probably too many to count. Perhaps enough to make me deaf in the near future. One thing I&amp;#39;ve realized - I keep going back for the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good concert is one where I’ve stood witness to the construction of a musical composition, built piece by piece from each member of the band, materializing into a single living, breathing entity; emblematic of those who devoted the time and energy into building something bigger than themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good design should mirror this experience. It should be collaborative. It should be defiant and intelligent, original but cognisant of the past. It should set expectations for any and all future interactions. It should make the person say, “now that was the best show I’ve ever been to.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because when it comes down to it, who would want the alternative? A bad performance is like something designed in Microsoft Word. It is obvious and unbalanced. It is “too loud” and often “has way too many drunk people.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So control the stage while designing. Give people an experience that not only captures their attention, but gives them a reason to listen.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The most difficult position to hire for in tech right now is not
engineering. It isn&amp;#39;t design. It is the hybrid position: the UX
developer. Or the UX designer. Or the implementation developer. Or the
CSS engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how difficult it is, I have no idea what the &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; title of
this position is. We seem to go back and forth every few weeks on what
to call it. But, this role has become incredibly crucial to how we and
most web companies operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically the responsibility for this position has fallen to
engineering, or maybe design, depending upon how your team ran things.
And it was the worst work. Cutting HTML, building terrible CSS. But
today process and standards have fallen into place to make this role a
legitimate one that people should build a career in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding how to optimize pages rendering, reduce CSS selector
lookups, organizing stylesheets and markup files. This is just the
start. Finding someone that can communicate between design and
engineering is a challenge and the people I&amp;#39;ve found to naturally fit
into this role excel at this. All of this before we ever start to talk
about accessibility, browser compatibility, standards compliance, and
responsive design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is barely anyone out there making a career in this role.
Perhaps because it has been traditionally looked down upon. Or perhaps
because engineering and design get the glory. The UX developer might
think of one&amp;#39;s self as the red-headed-stepchild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve taken a lot of efforts to bring the same quality we have in
engineering and design here to our HTML &amp;amp; CSS. We&amp;#39;ve adopted
&lt;a href="http://bem.info/"&gt;BEM&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://smacss.com/"&gt;SMACSS&lt;/a&gt;, and we&amp;#39;re constantly looking to improve
our process and the tools we use. Have other companies found similar issues with this
growing field? I&amp;#39;d like to hear from some people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(btw &lt;a href="mailto:jobs@dockyard.com"&gt;we&amp;#39;re hiring&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been exposed to many different work tracking/planning tools during my time as Project Manager. Early on it was tools like Excel, MS Project, IBM Rational. Later it was Jira, Kanban Boards, GitHub Issue Visualization Tools and physical PostIt Note boards. I would classify the former tools being more aligned with senior management&amp;#39;s desire to be “Well Informed” and the latter being more team centric and aligned with Iterative software development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with both distributed and co-located teams has challenged me to devise appropriate work tracking strategies for these very different team contexts.  However, one thing has remained the same to this day: I have never worked with a team that has determined they do not want to do any level of work tracking either in a high or low fidelity way regardless of the software development methodology being applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For purposes of this article I will be discussing some of the benefits we have seen in using a physical board with a couple of our co-located DockYard project teams. While I do maintain an appreciation of the big picture plan (aka High-Level Plan),  I have come to embrace a concept that is advocated in the field of Exercise Science - something I have been reading up on lately. I am sure this is not the only field of study citing this approach but wanted to mention this one as top of mind. It is the notion of setting smaller objectives to take one (us) closer to a larger goal. In terms of software development a goal would be synonymous with a product feature. By no means is this a new frontier in development planning, it is simply an application of some already acknowledged concepts.  What I believe is the slight twist is the setting of “Daily” objectives  in addition to full Iteration objectives. Consider this Project Carpe Diem!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At DockYard we are calling this approach “Game-Plan.” It covers the following four dimensions -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time (Days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tasks (Hrs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Role on Team&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At DockYard we harnesses the power of the daily standup meeting with low tech multi-colored Post-It Notes on a physical board in the office.  During Iteration planning we discuss the next prioritized feature(s), lay out the relevant sub-features in agreeable sequence, define tasks for those sub-features across all the practice areas on our team. We set an estimation guardrail to have tasks be no smaller than half day’s work and no larger than 2 - 3 days.  We discuss dependencies, hand offs, opportunities to parallelize (Optimize) work across different team members.  We start our iteration and reference the following board where we set/track daily team objectives - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/hwZuLsa.jpg" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of Iteration planning we take these tasks and convert them into GitHub issues aligned with a Milestone (Feature). However, we don’t typically reference GH in our standup meetings but do see this as a very effective means to trace our code to the agreed tasks and enable a logical platform for code review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other fringe benefits we are afforded by our “Game-Plan” on a daily basis include the following- &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearly show dependencies across the team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helps us focus WIP (Work in Progress)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows team to understand implications if a task is taking longer than expected - adjust our plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows us to suss out blockages that a team member might not reveal on their own &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a team member has capacity and someone is over capacity they can see where they can help out &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also note we do maintain visibility into the “High-Level Plan” at all times to ensure we continue to be thoughtful of implications to the overall project objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Carpe Diem fellow Project Teams - I’d love to hear if any teams out there are up to something similar or has learnings to share!&lt;/p&gt;
