    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a Project Manager, I have seen estimates in all forms - points, days, months, hours, mario coins, etc. Many say estimates in Software development are garbage and significant margin of error should be the expected norm. I believe this perspective to be true if estimation is conducted in a vacuum vs. as a means to have a conversation with prospective clients about what it is going to take to achieve their vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While estimation provides financial insight into a project, it also provides the project team with a point of reference when it comes to establishing schedules and conducting impact analysis when something needs to change (which is inevitable). As a project manager, a solid process by which we establish an estimate allows me to best serve the client and team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would question any firm who claims to offer a high confidence estimate to a prospective client without spending time mapping out the direction an application/product may take on paper. I am not talking about writing a 50 page requirements document (which I once did on a project 10 years before I knew any better).  I am talking about getting the “supporting&amp;quot; cast the context they need to provide an informed perspective on the complexity associated with building the application.  This complexity spans design, engineering, quality and any other overhead associated with a project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me paint this picture for you. Client X wants to build out a new application. The team to build said application provides client X with an estimate based off of a couple pre-sales meetings. Cost is negotiated until everyone around the table is happy with the economics and then the project is handed over to the project team and they are told to build “this” application in “this” amount of time. Client X is doomed regardless of whether or not that application is handed over in the agreed amount of time. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team has no context - Therefore, they are going to spend the first weeks of development getting up to speed as opposed to delivering working features putting the schedule behind right out of the gate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team does not &amp;quot;own&amp;quot; the estimate -  Someone else provided it on their behalf (who wants to be responsible for something they don’t own?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unexpected risks and complexity will (not “may”) put schedule at risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality will (not “may&amp;quot;) suffer because the team will attempt to meet the date commitment at the expense of quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid this at DockYard, we use a tool called Discovery. This is an intensive time-boxed exploration of a client’s business objectives, market and user needs, as well as technological possibilities. These inputs translate into wireframes and those wireframes translate into an estimable breakdown of deliverables that provides a platform to discuss scope, schedule and cost with our client. Our Discovery phase is cross-functional where we have designers and developers working hand in hand to understand the direction a client wants to go. We iterate on design concepts, we discuss technical direction and potential complexities, we map out scope in a way that allows clients to make decisions which may adjust cost and schedule up or down.   While this Discovery phase might feel like a tough nut to crack, it typically results in lower overall project cost, higher quality and better probability of staying on budget/schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent post by our own Mike Dupuis speaks to the value engineers can add to the “Discovery” phase of a project resulting in savings later in the project lifecycle-  &lt;a href="http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/09/12/features-as-business-objectives.html"&gt;Features as Business Objectives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you love them or hate them, estimates are here to stay in a client services context.  Therefore, instead of grumbling about them - make sure you&amp;#39;re using estimation as more than just a number but a means to have a conversation. Buyer beware of anyone who slaps an estimate on the table without providing you an explanation of how that estimate was derived.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity” - Well said by someone much more insightful than I!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is a federal holiday, and a day off for us at DockYard. On days like these, when I do not travel, I often go to the local library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today gave me the perfect opportunity to see how easy it would be to find a specific bit of information (&lt;em&gt;is the library open today?&lt;/em&gt;) on a library website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many government and community organizations, libraries are easy targets for ridicule when it comes to web design. Look at the outdated styles their site uses! How crowded it is! The HTML tables used for layout! The multi-colored announcements “designed” in Word! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am looking for today is something else: I want to judge the achievability of a specific task regardless of the presentation. Presentation (layout, hierarchy, and just plain good design) affects a user’s ability to achieve her goals, no doubt. I just want to start with the goals, and a specific measurement, rather than starting with the common pitfall of visual designers like myself: noticing the surface details that seem broken rather than the process behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here’s my experiment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Find out if the library is open today.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With a few considerations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be &lt;strong&gt;self evident&lt;/strong&gt; that a library is closed on a government holiday. It was not to me. I assume that most casual users have a vague suspicion that it may be closed, and would seek confirmation via the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I narrowed my search to just the homepage for this exercise, expecting to find the equivalent of a physical “Sorry, closed today!” door sign. And while many libraries provided the same information on Twitter or Facebook, it would be prohibitive to compare all these resources for this quick study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw most of these homepages for the first time today. A regular user of the local library may notice things differently than a new user, so for example the “CLOSED” text announcement that replaces a daily schedule of events, might stand out more for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked for three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; was the holiday at all on the homepage,  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;was it clear, and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;was it obvious?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got about halfway down the alphabetized list of Minuteman Library Network locations, and consider this to be a useful and fair sample for my purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s roll:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Acton&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3/3!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/ebDk2UJ.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is visually appealing and clear at the same time. I immediately got an answer to my question. Success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Arlington (Robbins Library)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;0/3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/CpqOqdR.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hours are clearly listed, but the holiday is not. Based on this page, I would assume it is open today — in fact, the clear listing of hours reinforces my wrong assumption. To see the holiday announcement, I would need to know to visit the Calendar. A shame, because the site looks quite polished to me and was likely re-designed fairly recently (guessing 2013, from its footer). An investment in a bit of user testing and research would have likely fixed this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Ashland&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Huh? 0.5/3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/yQ2dOww.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is no indication of library closure today, the Townhall is clearly  closed. As a local, I might know what that means for my library trip, so I gave 0.5 points for at least mentioning the holiday exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Bedford&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;0/3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/XhAfaNt.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s closure is not mentioned anywhere. Neither are the regular hours. I would look  either in About Us, or (eventually) see a link for Hours &amp;amp; Directions close to the top right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Belmont&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3/3!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/inJbhUs.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site doesn’t look like much, but it accomplishes my goal today perfectly. The library is clearly closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Brookline&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3/3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/jpBCY9k.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This library goes beyond my expectations by clearly listing not only today’s closure, but the entire holiday weekend for all three of its locations. The “Closed” notice is clear and immediately jumps to my attention. While there is no “closed TODAY” notice, I found this more detailed listing works just as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;7. Cambridge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;0/3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/QVg8HQO.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This library was a particular disappointment, because I have used it many times and the collection and its building are delightful. I am assuming it is one of the better funded libraries, given its location in direct proximity to Harvard. While the amount of content this page needs to show may be far greater than what a smaller local library deals with, this is no excuse for making things difficult to find. I get the feeling that the structure of the site is based on internal objectives, rather than user goals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s where today’s closure information is, in fact, located:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/W4eopoE.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have to do this:
- “find library hours” on the homepage
- select “holidays” among eleven listings
- see on the list that today, January 19th, is a holiday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;8. Concord&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;0/3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/zH7HVUy.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No indication of whether it is open today. The latest news seems to be the New Year’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;9. Dedham&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3/3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/8qHlEVH.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is immediately clear that the library is closed today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;10. Dover&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2/3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/ZmLY9lq.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a clear indication that the library is closed today. I had to scan the page for a while and read a few things before I noticed it, so it was not obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;11. Framingham&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2.5/3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/3j83pAP.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was almost obvious that “all libraries will be closed” today — even on this crowded page. I was distracted by the email sign-up notice, but the next thing I read was the closure notice. Not pretty, but close to functional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;12. Franklin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;0/3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/9CnV6Uv.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public library website seems to be just a layer of content on top of the Franklin local government site. Very confusing. No indication of closure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;13. Holliston&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2.5/3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/UNEAehM.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the closure information quickly, but it did not stand out enough (for my taste) from other news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;14. Lexington&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3.5/3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/n6IeQHX.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first indication of the library closure for MLK is in the featured image. It eventually changes to another feature, but there is a second indicator (Today’s hours: CLOSED) that makes the situation obvious. This fall-back “closed” notice got this site an extra .5 points on my scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What did I miss?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a very small test for a very specific user need. The sites that did well on my scale for “closing hours” may fail miserably at providing an answer to “what’s the street address?” or “can I renew my book online?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This test reiterated for me the importance of research and real-life user testing. Knowing what problems people might try to solve by going to a website, and where the site fails them, is necessary for most any meaningful improvement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How not to miss things:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a designer, I am often excited by a problem I see, and can jump to a solution I consider to be self-evident. (&lt;em&gt;The page is too crowded. Let’s change the typeface and layout!&lt;/em&gt;) But to make my solutions truly useful to other people, I must know what they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, I am a user with a specific need. Designers do not often start working on a project with solid knowledge of user needs. To bridge this gap, we test the current product (if it exists), create personas and scenarios, and ask lots of questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research could have prevented the “is the library closed?” problem. If there was one question I could ask people,  it would be “What was the most frustrating thing about this library?” Out of many responses, I would imagine at least one would mention showing up at the library to find it closed. Asking these types of general questions, not &lt;em&gt;“how satisfied are you with the library website? (on a scale from one to ten)”&lt;/em&gt;, will eventually lead us to meaningful design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, at least, save us the frustration of showing up to a closed library.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Six months ago today, I signed the letter officially accepting the offer
to join DockYard as a Senior Developer. It was the best decision I could have made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I announced my resignation to my previous employer, he jokingly said that if
they had known choosing Ember as a new client-side framework would
eventually make me want to pursue a new Ember-focused opportunity, they would
have chosen Angular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first started dipping my toes into Ember in late Spring 2013, some time after
Ember 1.0 RC3 was released. The Ember.js community was undeniably very active and
vibrant. That following June, I attended my first Boston Ember meetup,
where &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dgeb"&gt;Dan Gebhardt&lt;/a&gt; shared tips on testing Ember apps,
and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/twokul"&gt;Alex Navasardyan&lt;/a&gt; gave an introduction to Ember Data.
That&amp;#39;s how I came to know of DockYard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, some names started to emerge as familiar names within the
community. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bcardarella"&gt;Brian Cardarella&lt;/a&gt; became
known within our dev team as the one who wrote
&lt;a href="https://github.com/dockyard/ember-validations"&gt;ember-validations&lt;/a&gt;,
which we were using in our application. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rwjblue"&gt;Robert
Jackson&lt;/a&gt; was another name that kept popping
up on my Twitter and GitHub feeds. Call me a nerd if you will, but I was
as excited to have The Robert Jackson accept a fix that I submitted to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember-dev"&gt;ember-dev&lt;/a&gt; later that year to make builds
pass on Windows (with Rake at the time) as I would have been meeting a film celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DockYard further reinforced its reputation by organizing the Wicked Good Ember
conference in Boston, in June of 2014, which I of course attended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, when Brian reached out to me last July about joining the team, I
saw it as an opportunity that was really hard to pass on. Logistically,
I may have been better off staying where I was. I had a 40 min commute.
Joining DockYard would have doubled my commuting time. I was also
comfortable with the position I was holding, building out cool D3.js
charts with Ember, leading the development of new products, and getting
myself involved in all kinds of engineering team growth efforts. But
then there was DockYard. I went with my gut feeling instead and left
the warm and comfortable seat to face the exciting, though new and scary thing that was
DockYard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scary? Yes. From everything DockYard had done for the Boston community
to the talent behind its wheel, I was absolutely terrified of not
fitting in, that it was too elite for me. I checked out the team page on
the website and read everyone&amp;#39;s biography a number of times,
trying to picture what kind of co-workers I would be interacting with
daily. No matter how great the projects can be, culture is a big thing.
To my delight, the culture at DockYard is one that resonates the
most with me in my 10 years of professional career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DockYard has a well-balanced team of young, bright minds and more
seasoned developers, and I embrace that. There is none of that &amp;quot;I am
better than you&amp;quot; bullshit. Those I once viewed as Ember Gods and would
have been intimidated to talk to have been incredibly supportive and encouraging.
In the past, whenever I was involved in the hiring process for
Engineering, I had always wondered where all the great developers were.
Well, they&amp;#39;re here, happily employed at places like DockYard. If there
is one thing I can say about the company, it&amp;#39;s that it&amp;#39;s doing something
right to attract an amazingly talented and diverse crew. I&amp;#39;ve been
particularly impressed with our designers. It&amp;#39;s nice as a developer to
work on such nifty UIs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing consultancy work was new to me, and I had been warned about what I was
throwing myself into, that I&amp;#39;d end up losing focus on quality and just
hack solutions together quickly to meet client deadlines. I don&amp;#39;t doubt
that those kinds of situations can creep up, but so far, I&amp;#39;ve found
quite the opposite in the two projects that I&amp;#39;ve been involved in.
People care deeply about delivering clean, maintainable,
and well-tested code, and they&amp;#39;ve been especially adept at maintaining those
principles throughout the life of a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also refreshing to be able to work on a diverse portfolio of
projects. In the first few months since joining DockYard, I worked on a Rails and Ember app
that incorporated some really cool geolocation functionality. I am now
working on something that is unlike any other app I have ever developed.
The project includes Arduino code, Ember.js, and Node WebKit
(&lt;a href="http://nwjs.io/"&gt;NW.js&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best, of course, is DockYard&amp;#39;s mindset towards open source. I always
look forward to our &amp;quot;DockYard days&amp;quot; on Fridays to hack on code, blog
(this is my first one!), contribute back to the community in some ways,
or just to level up our craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as much as everyone works really hard, we also know when to have
fun, be it through Risk game tournaments, friendly games of Carcassonne
(or, as some would say, &amp;quot;Casserole&amp;quot;), or world exploring and building on
Minecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a job that you&amp;#39;ll love can be hard. Finding a team that you&amp;#39;ll
love working with can be twice as hard. And sometimes, it&amp;#39;s okay
to leave behind what is comfortable and secure, in light of
something promising, yet unknown. You may be pleasantly surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are looking for the next addition to our design team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal candidate is someone who can demonstrate a strong user-centric approach to their work, cares deeply about how their work will ultimately function, has been part of the user research process in the past, and shows strength in typography, color, and information layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re a design-driven software consultancy with design projects typically lasting 2-4 months. If you’re sick of working on the same product for years at a time, this may be a welcome change for you. Many of our client projects are “greenfield”, so you’ll have the opportunity to define the core concepts that will permeate throughout the application and be built upon as the product grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also heavily involved in the Boston design community. We very successfully ran our first UX East Camp last Nov, we host and coorganize UX Boston, run UX Happy Hour, speak at industry conferences and meetups, and blog about our experience (blog traffic is around 300 hits per day). If you’re publishing your work and articles through DockYard they will get traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be expected to take part in your community and we will give you tools to do so. We run weekly internal talks on a rotating schedule, run company wide peer-reviews of blog posts, and will fly you to one industry conference a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DockYard also has a full engineering team on staff (actually much larger than the design team by about 2-to-1). They are experts in both front and back end technologies. The implementation of your work will be on-point and very well engineered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We offer better than market rates. Full health and dental coverage (no matter what your coverage requirements are). We also have 6 weeks of vacation time per year. 4 of those are mandatory vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an on-site position in Boston, MA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this type of working environment interests you, then we’d love to hear from you. &lt;a href="mailto:jobs@dockyard.com"&gt;E-mail us&lt;/a&gt; (we do not work with recruiters) to get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/post-assets/maria/blog-bathroom-expectations-01.jpg" alt=""&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This is what we walked through one Friday evening as we were leaving work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The building we work in is under construction. There are many small and large annoyances that come with a live construction site nearby. One thing has been particularly awkward: access to our restrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might suspect, most if not all construction workers are men. There is active pipe work going on in the building, so they often need to do work directly inside the women&amp;#39;s restroom at random times throughout the day. We would discover that a man is working on a ceiling duct in a space we expected to be for women only, and it has caused a considerable amount of tension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there may be many alternatives to doing construction work like this without warning, with less disruption of our work day, I had also started to question why this behavior felt like such an intrusion. After all, there are covered stalls with doors that go down close to the ground, so there&amp;#39;s still a significant amount of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason seems to be not the exposure itself, but the fact that a certain space (e.g. beyond the door that says &amp;quot;WOMEN&amp;quot;) has been designated for a specific use, and is limited to one gender. This situation is not default - in fact, there are a few alternatives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often located in smaller restaurants or coffee shops, a single-user bathroom normally does not have a gender restriction. One would simply wait for it to be vacant, and use it without a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;family&amp;quot; bathroom (explicitly marked as such) is for one or many users. It is roomier than the &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; bathrooms next to it, and normally utilized by a parent with children, or someone using a wheelchair. Few eyebrows would be raised when several people at once, regardless of gender, walk out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MOMA PS1 there is an explicitly declared unisex shared restroom. It has three stalls (with doors) and a urinal facing the back wall. It is a bit unsettling to use for the first time, but the explicit declaration makes it feel like a shared awkward experience, rather than a disadvantage of one group of people or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary - our expectations always determine what we consider to be unacceptable. The example of bathrooms in our office building clearly shows that a construction worker&amp;#39;s expectation (&amp;quot;this is my work site&amp;quot;) and my female co-workers&amp;#39; expectation (&amp;quot;this is a space for women only&amp;quot;) did not line up. More importantly, both parties were &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; in their own way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me as a designer, this awkward situation clearly illustrates how important it is to understand a client&amp;#39;s or a colleague&amp;#39;s expectations in any given situation. It is entirely possible – especially when working with a client in an industry I am not familiar with – to commit terrible missteps without even knowing they happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid the kind of toxic misunderstanding, it is important to communicate assumptions (even the &amp;quot;duh!&amp;quot; kind) early on in a project. It may feel awkward to have to say out loud the things that you consider to be understood by everyone involved. Get over it. When you find and defuse that one thing you did not agree was a given, it will all be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Should we consider allowing the display of all private or risky information to the owner strictly through a prompt?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This could include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;username&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;e-mail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;birth date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;social security number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit card info (maybe never show it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;account numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you get it by now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, one little bit of information that someone tweets about themselves in a screenshot could mean they’re sharing a useful piece of data to a DOXX operation by some douchebag on the internet. That’s the theory, but as I know very little about DOXXing it may not make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why am I thinking this?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just tweeted a photo and I realized after the fact I might have put some sensitive information in it. Not like credit cards or actionable items to any normal viewer, but the kind of information that could add up to something a technically sophisticated malicious person might like. Turns out it was just my name, which seems ok to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Because users don’t really know better and they never will&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a lot of time resisting the “our users don’t know” mantra in certain scenarios, and I can tell you why sometimes still resist it, but I digress. When it comes to security, our brains aren’t very good at remembering the pieces of information we’ve shared. I have 4k+ tweets and I know a lot of people are at that or beyond. How can we be sure we haven’t shared too much information? I don’t think we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could certainly be a pain in the designer&amp;#39;s ass to worry about protecting the user from doing something harmful to themselves (on purpose yet without being aware) in addition to everything else our daunting jobs require us to, but maybe this really warrants consideration by designers. Maybe it’s part of the job.&lt;/p&gt;
