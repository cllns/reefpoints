    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been into comics or graphic novels. They’ve always remained in my periphery, but I never took the time to be interested in them. I appreciated good illustration, but rarely watched animations (except for Disney and Pixar of course) and pretty much ruled out that I would ever “get” the appeal of a comic book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a data mining class last semester, and we discussed the importance of &lt;strong&gt;visual storytelling&lt;/strong&gt;. I jotted down notes and took away a comprehensive understanding of design implications - keep colors relative and consistent, scale, got it, check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/camd/artdesign/people/dietmar-offenhuber/"&gt;Dietmar&lt;/a&gt;, my professor, had mentioned a book by Scott McCloud, &lt;a href="http://scottmccloud.com/2-print/1-uc/"&gt;Understanding Comics&lt;/a&gt;, and suggested looking to comics and film as an important metaphor for data visualization. Though I didn’t pay much attention at the time, this notion stuck with me, and a few weeks ago I invested in that very book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comics are a brilliant demonstration of visualizations that show multivariate information. Interactions, emotions, time, and space are all present, concurrent, and in flux - using frames and transitions to move the reader from one thought to the next. Comics pay attention to the readability of a story, by piecing together &amp;quot;juxtaposed images in deliberate sequence.&amp;quot; (McCloud, &lt;em&gt;Understanding Comics&lt;/em&gt;) Unlike film, however, the static nature of comics leaves room for creative challenges balancing those variables simultaneously, especially the evolution of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of information graphics is subject to the same dimensional considerations. Data Visualization is a balance of data analytics, visual representations, and a narration which provides a context for each investigation. Designing complex data to be comprehensive, interactive, and inviting is quite a challenge. While there are tools we can use to inspire visualization methods and techniques, there is much more to consider. There is an entire science behind visual cognition; why humans respond to certain characteristics faster than others (to be elaborated on at another point in time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To incorporate storytelling into data visualization is to consider who we design for. Like comics, we must create an environment for the audience to become immersed, and the presentation of ideas shapes the interaction. The visual language we use, the way we sequence through visualizations, directly influences the legibility of the information. When we embrace the humanism of comprehension and perception, we design the experience to promote the success of the reader&amp;#39;s ability to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s design to agitate curiosity and engagement. How can we utilize visual storytelling to inspire research, critical analysis, and conversation? Harnessing the power of design, we can draw inspiration from comics, and present information in a way that considers how the mind observes and acquires ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it were, I’m now devouring comics - making up for lost time. I’ve put my summer reading list on hold - to make time for books shared with me from fellow designers at DockYard, who maybe not so surprisingly, already have a deep appreciation and love for the brilliant medium that is comics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have attended a lot of concerts, probably too many to count. Perhaps enough to make me deaf in the near future. One thing I&amp;#39;ve realized - I keep going back for the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good concert is one where I’ve stood witness to the construction of a musical composition, built piece by piece from each member of the band, materializing into a single living, breathing entity; emblematic of those who devoted the time and energy into building something bigger than themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good design should mirror this experience. It should be collaborative. It should be defiant and intelligent, original but cognisant of the past. It should set expectations for any and all future interactions. It should make the person say, “now that was the best show I’ve ever been to.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because when it comes down to it, who would want the alternative? A bad performance is like something designed in Microsoft Word. It is obvious and unbalanced. It is “too loud” and often “has way too many drunk people.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So control the stage while designing. Give people an experience that not only captures their attention, but gives them a reason to listen.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The most difficult position to hire for in tech right now</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The most difficult position to hire for in tech right now is not
engineering. It isn&amp;#39;t design. It is the hybrid position: the UX
developer. Or the UX designer. Or the implementation developer. Or the
CSS engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how difficult it is, I have no idea what the &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; title of
this position is. We seem to go back and forth every few weeks on what
to call it. But, this role has become incredibly crucial to how we and
most web companies operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically the responsibility for this position has fallen to
engineering, or maybe design, depending upon how your team ran things.
And it was the worst work. Cutting HTML, building terrible CSS. But
today process and standards have fallen into place to make this role a
legitimate one that people should build a career in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding how to optimize pages rendering, reduce CSS selector
lookups, organizing stylesheets and markup files. This is just the
start. Finding someone that can communicate between design and
engineering is a challenge and the people I&amp;#39;ve found to naturally fit
into this role excel at this. All of this before we ever start to talk
about accessibility, browser compatibility, standards compliance, and
responsive design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is barely anyone out there making a career in this role.
Perhaps because it has been traditionally looked down upon. Or perhaps
because engineering and design get the glory. The UX developer might
think of one&amp;#39;s self as the red-headed-stepchild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve taken a lot of efforts to bring the same quality we have in
engineering and design here to our HTML &amp;amp; CSS. We&amp;#39;ve adopted
&lt;a href="http://bem.info/"&gt;BEM&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://smacss.com/"&gt;SMACSS&lt;/a&gt;, and we&amp;#39;re constantly looking to improve
our process and the tools we use. Have other companies found similar issues with this
growing field? I&amp;#39;d like to hear from some people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(btw &lt;a href="mailto:jobs@dockyard.com"&gt;we&amp;#39;re hiring&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Project Carpe Diem - "Game Plan"</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been exposed to many different work tracking/planning tools during my time as Project Manager. Early on it was tools like Excel, MS Project, IBM Rational. Later it was Jira, Kanban Boards, GitHub Issue Visualization Tools and physical PostIt Note boards. I would classify the former tools being more aligned with senior management&amp;#39;s desire to be “Well Informed” and the latter being more team centric and aligned with Iterative software development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with both distributed and co-located teams has challenged me to devise appropriate work tracking strategies for these very different team contexts.  However, one thing has remained the same to this day: I have never worked with a team that has determined they do not want to do any level of work tracking either in a high or low fidelity way regardless of the software development methodology being applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For purposes of this article I will be discussing some of the benefits we have seen in using a physical board with a couple of our co-located DockYard project teams. While I do maintain an appreciation of the big picture plan (aka High-Level Plan),  I have come to embrace a concept that is advocated in the field of Exercise Science - something I have been reading up on lately. I am sure this is not the only field of study citing this approach but wanted to mention this one as top of mind. It is the notion of setting smaller objectives to take one (us) closer to a larger goal. In terms of software development a goal would be synonymous with a product feature. By no means is this a new frontier in development planning, it is simply an application of some already acknowledged concepts.  What I believe is the slight twist is the setting of “Daily” objectives  in addition to full Iteration objectives. Consider this Project Carpe Diem!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At DockYard we are calling this approach “Game-Plan.” It covers the following four dimensions -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time (Days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tasks (Hrs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Role on Team&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At DockYard we harnesses the power of the daily standup meeting with low tech multi-colored Post-It Notes on a physical board in the office.  During Iteration planning we discuss the next prioritized feature(s), lay out the relevant sub-features in agreeable sequence, define tasks for those sub-features across all the practice areas on our team. We set an estimation guardrail to have tasks be no smaller than half day’s work and no larger than 2 - 3 days.  We discuss dependencies, hand offs, opportunities to parallelize (Optimize) work across different team members.  We start our iteration and reference the following board where we set/track daily team objectives - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/hwZuLsa.jpg" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of Iteration planning we take these tasks and convert them into GitHub issues aligned with a Milestone (Feature). However, we don’t typically reference GH in our standup meetings but do see this as a very effective means to trace our code to the agreed tasks and enable a logical platform for code review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other fringe benefits we are afforded by our “Game-Plan” on a daily basis include the following- &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearly show dependencies across the team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helps us focus WIP (Work in Progress)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows team to understand implications if a task is taking longer than expected - adjust our plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows us to suss out blockages that a team member might not reveal on their own &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a team member has capacity and someone is over capacity they can see where they can help out &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also note we do maintain visibility into the “High-Level Plan” at all times to ensure we continue to be thoughtful of implications to the overall project objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Carpe Diem fellow Project Teams - I’d love to hear if any teams out there are up to something similar or has learnings to share!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>On Selling UX</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Talk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are talking about the difficulties of selling UX process to their boss, their clients, or their prospective clients. They&amp;#39;re upset that they don&amp;#39;t have the tools to create the caliber of experience others are building and it&amp;#39;s all because a few people aren&amp;#39;t buying into their process. You might have heard it or said it yourself that those in the way &amp;quot;just don&amp;#39;t get UX&amp;quot;. I know I&amp;#39;ve said it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this point of view, we appear to be looking at the problem as a matter of conversion; turning someone who isn&amp;#39;t interested in change of process into someone who&amp;#39;ll embrace it. It&amp;#39;s a hard sell and, if you&amp;#39;ve ever experienced being hung up on while cold calling someone, you&amp;#39;ll know that your chances of failure are much greater than your chance of conversion. But don&amp;#39;t let that scare you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like the design process itself, there are many ways to approach this problem. Success in your approach is a matter of understanding perspective and - dare I say - empathy for those in the critical path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have a habit of creating definitions in our minds of what other people do from what we hear around the office (or internet) and they&amp;#39;re often pretty far off base. Those definitions become our foundation for what it means to be those other things: a designer, a developer, a product manager, a CEO. Those definitions, baseless or not, are used to judge the value of the things we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example might be that most people realize they need a software developer to build an application but they may not understand the angles to be considered, the processes for discovering those angles, or the costs involved. It&amp;#39;s easily misunderstood and can be a surprise for those outside of your industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Shared Values&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We intend to create a great product and we understand there are many variations in process that could bring it to life. As creators, that process can often be poorly preconceived and unnecessarily limited before we get a hand in it. We have a few options from here to deliver our full value, and selling isn&amp;#39;t one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aaron Scott from &lt;a href="http://leap.agency/"&gt;Leap&lt;/a&gt; gave a talk at &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/uxboston/events/136304392/"&gt;UX Boston Conf&lt;/a&gt; about doing your best in getting to know those you&amp;#39;re working with to help deliver a winning concept to the client. This approach holds true in more ways than just reaching a final design; it will help you gain the buy-in you need to perform at your full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakeholder may understand what you do, need some experience of your process before understanding, or maybe they&amp;#39;re not ready for it all. You need to know that they&amp;#39;re acting off of their definitions, and it&amp;#39;s not always their fault for having an incomplete picture. Just the same, it is equally important for us to understand them and their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they&amp;#39;re not ready, convincing them otherwise will cause anxiety during the project and potentially cause issues of trust with you or future designers if things don&amp;#39;t go well. Use your best judgment and tread lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your work is primarily visual it can be especially difficult to get the buy in you need. Most of the stakeholders will have had vision for their entire lives and trust themselves to judge what they feel is good and bad. They have their own tastes, their own definitions of what you do, and their own expectations of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our value as designers is best understood when demonstrated and this is your most powerful tool to gain buy in. Make room for them to be part of your design conversation. Problem solve and communicate with them like you might your design team. Let them breath the same air you are and replace your salesmanship with collaboration. Use this method instead of presentations and cold hard salesmanship or politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t believe they&amp;#39;re a good fit to collaborate with your design team, you may wish to pass on their project. Consider them a &amp;quot;client in training&amp;quot;, give them your best advice, and set them free. Of course this isn&amp;#39;t as easy when working in-house, where I would hope that if you&amp;#39;ve come to this conclusion you&amp;#39;d start looking for a more collaborative environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So stop &lt;em&gt;selling&lt;/em&gt; UX. Look around, listen, ask questions, and help the client in training see further before you put a contract in front of them. Your process of gaining an understanding of the product, users, and their context will sell your expertise all on its own. If they&amp;#39;re not ready, which is up to you to decide, set them free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They may not always be a returning client, but they will respect you for being honest with them every step of the way - and that&amp;#39;s a lifelong trust.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I enjoy the look of hand-drawn things. And I use patterns a lot. But when the two are combined, the results are often disappointing. My least favorite thing is to see a pattern where identical copies of a hand drawn object were repeated without variation. The automatic repetition here is not appropriate to the shaky handmade look of the art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect reminds me of Office circa 1995 (remember the classic marble and granite patterns?) or the obviously tiled walls in video game environments. In a 3D environment, a small size of the tile that causes this obvious tiled look is a necessity to conserve processing power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember these?
&lt;img src="/images/post-assets/maria/001-bad-textures.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I want to use hand drawn repeat patterns in my work, and it would be impractical to draw a thousand individual pieces to create the pattern, I experimented to determine exactly how many pieces I need to preserve the varied look, while being able to tile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I intentionally draw similar objects, I found that 15-30 copies will make a decent repeat pattern. I draw more than I need, then squint and get rid of a few that are too dissimilar. Once pieces are arranged on the pattern, there will always be a few that stick out and attract attention to the “seams” between your pattern tiles. To solve this, I leave only a small amount of variation in both shape and placement, and I repeat a few of the shapes several times in a single tile. This distracts from the “edges” of the tiles because repetition happens on two different rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pattern element 2 is repeated several times within one unit.
&lt;img src="/images/post-assets/maria/002-repeat-pieces.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to get as far away as I can from the obvious square tiled look, I also experimented with other manners of tiling. Adobe Illustrator offers brick (offset), hexagonal and other options, but I eventually need to go back to a rectangular repeating unit because I want to use my pattern in browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rectangular repeat unit is used to make hexagonal tiles.
&lt;img src="/images/post-assets/maria/003-repeat-hex.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is one of the patterns I ended up making in this non-repeated style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One unit of the repeat pattern.
&lt;img src="/images/post-assets/maria/004-trees.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used this tree, circled, several times inside one repeating unit.
&lt;img src="/images/post-assets/maria/005-trees.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pieces are aligned to the grid, of course, but they are hand drawn so sizes are slightly off. I intentionally spaced them slightly off the grid as well, but preserved the overall balanced appearance (just squint and fix whatever looks off  - very scientific!)
&lt;img src="/images/post-assets/maria/006-trees.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;And finally - here are the patterns!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/post-assets/maria/099-swatches-of-all-patterns.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/downloadables/patterns/pattern-swatches-CS5-and-later.ai"&gt;Download the Illustrator file&lt;/a&gt; and use these patterns in any project. We only ask that you do not resell them. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
